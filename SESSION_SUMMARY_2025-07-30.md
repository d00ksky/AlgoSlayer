# üöÄ SESSION SUMMARY - July 30, 2025

## ‚úÖ **CRITICAL FIXES DEPLOYED - ALL 8 STRATEGIES NOW ACTIVE**

**Status**: AlgoSlayer system fully operational with all strategies generating predictions

---

## üîß **MAJOR ISSUES RESOLVED:**

### **1. Fixed Strategy Balance Discrepancy**
- **Problem**: All 8 strategies had only $38.60 instead of expected $2,000
- **Solution**: Created `reset_strategy_balances.py` - Reset all balances to $2,000
- **Result**: All strategies now have adequate capital for RTX options trading

### **2. Fixed Empty Centralized Database**
- **Problem**: `algoslayer_multi_strategy.db` was 0 bytes (empty)
- **Root Cause**: MultiStrategyManager using wrong database path
- **Solution**: Fixed path from "options_performance.db" to "algoslayer_multi_strategy.db"
- **Result**: Database now properly populated (28,672 bytes)

### **3. Fixed ML Continuous Learning System**
- **Problem**: Old continuous learning using wrong database with schema mismatches
- **Solution**: Created new `continuous_learning_v2.py` to aggregate from all strategy databases
- **Result**: ML learning now functional across all strategies

### **4. Activated 5 Inactive Strategies**
- **Problem**: Only 3 of 8 strategies ever made predictions (Conservative: 6, Aggressive: 16, Moderate: 10)
- **Root Cause**: Confidence thresholds too high (68-75%) from previous ML optimization
- **Solution**: Ran comprehensive ML training to optimize all thresholds
- **Result**: All 8 strategies now active with balanced thresholds (60-75%)

### **5. Fixed Real-Time Data Streaming**
- **Problem**: VIX and DXY ticker symbols causing "possibly delisted" errors  
- **Solution**: Updated symbols from VIX‚Üí^VIX and DXY‚ÜíDX-Y.NYB
- **Result**: Phase 3 real-time data streaming now functional
