# 🎯 AlgoSlayer Current Status - June 25, 2025

## ✅ **SESSION COMPLETE - READY FOR CONTINUATION**

---

## 🚀 **WHAT WE ACCOMPLISHED TODAY:**

### **✅ ML Optimizations Deployed to Live System**
- **Applied optimized signal weights** from Conservative strategy (best performer)
- **Raised confidence thresholds**: Moderate 60%→70%, Aggressive 50%→65%
- **Activated capital allocation**: Conservative 50%, Moderate 35%, Aggressive 15%
- **Live deployment successful** with zero downtime

### **📊 Current System Status:**
- **Server**: `root@64.226.96.90` - ✅ ACTIVE (14+ hours stable)
- **Trading**: Market open, ML-optimized cycles running every 15 minutes
- **Selectivity**: 50% confidence signals correctly rejected (below new thresholds)
- **Performance**: System now requiring 65-75% confidence for trades

---

## 🎯 **TO CONTINUE SEAMLESSLY:**

### **1. Read the Updated Session Summary:**
- **File**: `SESSION_SUMMARY_ML_OPTIMIZATION.md`
- **Contains**: Complete context, next steps, and monitoring commands
- **Updated**: June 25, 2025 15:30 CEST with today's progress

### **2. Start Next Session with These Commands:**
```bash
# Quick system check
ssh root@64.226.96.90 'date && systemctl status rtx-trading | head -10'

# Check ML optimization impact
ssh root@64.226.96.90 'journalctl -u rtx-trading --since="1 day ago" | grep -E "(confidence|threshold|Opened position)" | tail -20'

# Telegram monitoring
# Send: /ml_status, /positions, /dashboard
```

### **3. Priority Focus Areas:**
1. **Monitor ML optimization effectiveness** (1-2 weeks)
2. **Track win rate improvements** (+3-6% target per strategy)
3. **Validate higher confidence thresholds** are improving trade quality
4. **Consider next enhancement** (Options Greeks or multi-timeframe)
