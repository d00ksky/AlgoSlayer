# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

AlgoSlayer is an AI-powered autonomous RTX **OPTIONS** trading system that combines 12 AI trading signals with real options data, paper trading simulation, and machine learning. It predicts specific option contracts, tracks real P&L, and learns from actual trading outcomes to improve over time.

**🏆 STATUS: WORLD-CLASS OPTIMIZED SYSTEM - ALL ENHANCEMENTS DEPLOYED (June 26, 2025)**

## 🚨 **CRITICAL: Service Architecture**

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: The system currently runs TWO trading services:

1. **`rtx-trading.service`** → `run_server.py` → **TELEGRAM BOT RUNS HERE** 🤖
2. **`multi-strategy-trading.service`** → `run_multi_strategy.py` → Multi-strategy system

**For Telegram bot changes**: Always restart `rtx-trading.service`, NOT `multi-strategy-trading.service`

```bash
# ✅ CORRECT - Updates Telegram bot
sudo systemctl restart rtx-trading.service

# ❌ WRONG - Telegram bot not here
sudo systemctl restart multi-strategy-trading.service
```

**Full documentation**: See `SERVICES_ARCHITECTURE.md` for complete details.
