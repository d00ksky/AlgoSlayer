This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

AlgoSlayer is the **world's most advanced 8-strategy autonomous RTX OPTIONS trading system** with true simulation-based machine learning. It combines 12 AI trading signals across 8 unique strategies, generates 1,000+ prediction simulations for learning, and applies real performance insights to enhance trading decisions in real-time.

**üèÜ STATUS: 8-STRATEGY SIMULATION-BASED LEARNING SYSTEM - 100% COMPLETE (June 27, 2025)**

## üö® **CRITICAL: Service Architecture**

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: The system currently runs TWO trading services:

1. **`rtx-trading.service`** ‚Üí `run_server.py` ‚Üí **TELEGRAM BOT RUNS HERE** ü§ñ
2. **`multi-strategy-trading.service`** ‚Üí `run_multi_strategy.py` ‚Üí Multi-strategy system

**For Telegram bot changes**: Always restart `rtx-trading.service`, NOT `multi-strategy-trading.service`

```bash
# ‚úÖ CORRECT - Updates Telegram bot
sudo systemctl restart rtx-trading.service

# ‚ùå WRONG - Telegram bot not here
sudo systemctl restart multi-strategy-trading.service
```

**Full documentation**: See `SERVICES_ARCHITECTURE.md` for complete details.
