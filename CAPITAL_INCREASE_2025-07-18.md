# 💰 Strategy Capital Increase - July 18, 2025

## 🎯 **What We Did**

### **Increased Capital for All 8 Strategies**
- **Before**: $1,000 per strategy
- **After**: $2,000 per strategy (+100% increase)

## 📊 **Why This Was Necessary**

### **The Problem:**
- RTX options cost ~$283 per contract
- With $1,000 capital and 15-25% position sizing:
  - Conservative (15%): Only $150 available ❌
  - Moderate (20%): Only $200 available ❌
  - Aggressive (25%): Only $250 available ❌
- **Result**: No strategies could afford options despite high confidence signals

### **The Solution:**
With $2,000 per strategy:
- Conservative (15%): $300 available ✅
- Moderate (20%): $400 available ✅
- Aggressive (25%): $500 available ✅
- **Result**: All strategies can now afford RTX options

## 🔧 **Technical Changes**

### Files Modified:
1. `/opt/rtx-trading/src/core/multi_strategy_manager.py`
   - `starting_capital = 2000.0`
   - Database default: `2000.0`

2. `/opt/rtx-trading/src/core/parallel_strategy_runner.py`
   - Default `initial_balance = 2000.0`

3. Database Updated:
   - All 8 strategies updated from $1,000 → $2,000
   - P&L history preserved

## 💡 **What to Monitor**

### **Next 24-48 Hours:**

## 🎯 **Key Insight**

This wasn't about making strategies "less selective" - it was about giving them **realistic capital** to execute their already-excellent analysis. The high confidence signals (85.5%) and strong AI consensus were already there - the strategies just needed adequate buying power to act on them.

**The system remains as intelligent and selective as before - now with the capital to execute!** 🚀
