    "\ud83d\udcc8 INCREASE WIN RATE:",
    "   - Raise confidence threshold from 60% to 75%+",
    "   - Require more signals to agree (4+ out of 12)",
    "   - Focus on high-conviction setups only",
    "\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f IMPROVE RISK MANAGEMENT:",
    "   - Reduce stop loss from 50% to 40%",
    "   - Add time-based stops (exit at 25% time decay)",
    "   - Consider smaller position sizes",
    "\ud83c\udfaf STRATEGY IMPROVEMENTS:",
    "   - Track which signals actually correlate with profitable trades",
    "   - Implement signal weight adjustment based on P&L performance",
    "   - Add earnings calendar integration for timing",
    "   - Focus on RTX-specific patterns (defense contracts, earnings)",
    "\ud83d\udcda LEARNING SYSTEM:",
    "   - Run system for 2-4 weeks to collect 20+ trades",
    "   - Track signal combinations that lead to profits",
    "   - Analyze optimal DTE, IV, and Delta combinations",
